## ASCII Art Web Application
## Overview
This is a simple web application that generates ASCII art based on user input. The application uses the Go programming language and the net/http package to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Features
Users can input text and select a banner style to generate ASCII art.
The application supports three banner styles:
  * **Standard**: A classic, simple style for ASCII art.
  * **Shadow**: A style that adds a shadow effect to the ASCII art.
  * **Thinkertoy**: A style that uses a more playful, toy-like font for the ASCII art.
The input text is limited to 500 characters.

## How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command `go run main.go` or `go run .` to start the server.
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.

## Endpoints
/: The home page of the application, which displays a form for user input.
/ascii-art: The endpoint that handles form submissions and generates ASCII art.

## Error Handling
The application handles errors in the following ways:

404 Not Found: Returned when the requested URL is not found.
405 Method Not Allowed: Returned when the request method is not POST.
400 Bad Request: Returned when the input text exceeds 500 characters or the banner style is invalid.
500 Internal Server Error: Returned when an unexpected error occurs.

## Dependencies

functions: A custom package that provides functions for reading banner templates and generating ASCII art.

## Styling
